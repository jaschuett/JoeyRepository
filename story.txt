There once was a man named Linus. He loved to type and hated to click icons.

Linus also carried around his blanket that he has had since birth. He also 
still lives in his mothers basement and loves to argue and "destory" silly
liberals on online forums.

Linus later decided that it was time for a name change. He was confident enough
in public speaking; he was ready to make a movement. His new name was Ben.
